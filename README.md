# Road Sign Classification using Convolutional Neural Network

## Key Terms and Concepts

* **Convolutional Neural Network:** 
    * Imagine a digital brain that's been specifically trained to understand and interpret images. This brain can pick out important details from an image, like the shape, color, and symbols on a road sign, and understand how these details relate to each other. This makes CNNs perfect for tasks like identifying road signs from a picture, as they can learn to recognize the patterns that make up each sign.

* **Data Augmentation:**
    * This is a technique we use to make our digital brain even smarter. Imagine if you only ever saw a stop sign from one angle, in perfect lighting conditions. You might struggle to recognize it at night, or when viewed from the side. To avoid this, we take our existing images of road signs and create new ones by rotating, scaling, or cropping them. This helps our system get better at recognizing road signs under a variety of conditions, making it more versatile and reliable.

* **Classification Task:**
    * This is the main job of our digital brain. It's about sorting things into categories. In our case, the task is to correctly categorize different road signs. It's like having a super-fast, super-accurate filing system that can instantly sort new images into one of 43 different categories of road signs.

* **Accuracy and F1 Score:**
    * These are the ways we measure how well our system is doing its job.

    * <u>Accuracy</u>: This is a straightforward way to understand how well our system is performing. It's like a report card for our digital brain. If our system looks at 100 road signs and correctly identifies 95 of them, then its accuracy is 95%. But accuracy alone doesn't tell the whole story. It doesn't distinguish between the different types of errors our system might make. For example, it doesn't tell us if our system is consistently misidentifying one particular type of sign.
    
    * <u>F1 Score</u>: This is where the F1 score comes in. The F1 score is a more nuanced measure of performance. It considers both the *precision* and the *recall* of our system. **Precision** is a measure of how many of the signs our system identified correctly out of all the signs it thought were of a particular type. **Recall**, on the other hand, measures how many signs of a particular type our system identified correctly out of all the actual signs of that type in the dataset. The F1 score combines these two measures into a single number, giving us a more balanced view of our system's performance. It's particularly useful in situations where we care equally about precision and recall, like in our case where both correctly identifying a sign and not missing any sign are equally important.

* **Loss Functions:**
    * In the world of machine learning, a loss function is like a compass for our model. It's a mathematical way of measuring how far off our model's predictions are from the actual results. The goal of our model, like a hiker trying to reach a destination, is to minimize this loss, making the predictions as close as possible to the real results. 

    * Imagine you're playing a game of darts. Each time you throw a dart, you aim for the bullseye. But let's say your dart lands somewhere else on the board. The distance between where your dart landed and the bullseye is similar to the concept of loss in machine learning. Just like you'd adjust your aim based on where your last dart landed, a machine learning model adjusts its predictions based on the loss.
